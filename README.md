# Smart Water Flow Controller 🚰

An Arduino-based IoT project to control water flow between tanks based on real-time water level detection.

## 📌 Overview
This system detects when the water level in a secondary tank drops below a set threshold and activates a relay to transfer water from the main tank. Once the desired level is reached, it stops the pump automatically.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Arduino UNO
- C++ (Arduino IDE)
- Water Level Sensor (digital output)
- Relay Module
- Basic Electronics Components

## ✨ Features
- Real-time water level detection
- Automatic water pumping control
- Low-cost and efficient IoT solution
- Code fully written in C++ using Arduino IDE
